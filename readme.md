# Small Creature AI

A small experiment to make a lightweight wandering creature. Broken into parts.


# Scenes
## SmallCreatureAI

Wherein I torture a small green Dalek-like creature in an anonymous hell. Red cubes wander around blind and randomly. Green thing does the same but spooks when a red cube gets too close.


## SmallCreature-w-Animator

Simple experiment to animate flying creature by animating a `<Constant Force> `component. Weird, but functional.


## BirdAI

Wherin the torture resumes. Combines flying ability with red cubes.

I have mixed feelings that this one seems to end with the green creature 'flying' over the bounary walls and falling into oblivion. Perhaps it is for the best.
